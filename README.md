# What is the purpose of this?
- I made this project because of a inventory issue we had in my dads small buisness. So I created this to manage everything and make sure the inventory is up to date. 

# Features
- List out the total inventory
- Automatically update inventory whenever something changes.
- Tracks and changes that may occur.
- Adds a new category if it doesnâ€™t already exist.
- Adds a specified quantity of an item within a category.
- Removes a specified quantity of an item and deletes it from the category if the quantity reaches zero.
- Prints the changes in inventory for tracking purposes (could be extended to save to a log file).
- Updates inventory based on "add" or "remove" actions and logs these changes.
- files changes will be saved automatically.
- Optional servives of pandas to have predective analysis on your side.
  
  
# How to use this 
Simply just run the script and you will see gui on your desktop. From that you can add, remove and manage your piles of data.  

# Issues
- Do not know how to set up pandas properly

# Future Enhancements
- Do more advanced metrics with this like predetive what items can sell more stuff like that.
- Add a scanner system to it so I can just scan it into the system instead of typing it.
